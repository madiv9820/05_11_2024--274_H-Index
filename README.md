# Finding H-Index (All Approaches) 

- ## Approach 1:- Sorting
    - ### Intuition
        - The h-index is a metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of a researcher. Given a list of citations for each of a researcher's papers, the h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the researcher has published `h` papers that each have at least `h` citations.

    - ### Example of h-Index:
        If a researcher has the following citation counts: `[3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, their h-index is `3` because:
        - There are `3` papers with at least `3` citations each (`[3, 5, 6]`).
        - Increasing `h` to `4` would require `4` papers with at least `4` citations, which is not satisfied.

    - ### Approach
        1. **Sort the Citations**: First, sort the list of citations in ascending order. This makes it easier to count how many papers meet the threshold for each potential h-index.
        
        2. **Iterate to Find h-Index**: Start from `h_Index = 0` and check if there are at least `h_Index + 1` papers with `h_Index + 1` citations.
            - For a sorted list `citations`, if `citations[len(citations) - 1 - h_Index] > h_Index`, then we can increment `h_Index`.
            - This condition checks if there are enough papers with at least `h_Index` citations from the rightmost end of the sorted list.

        3. **Return h-Index**: The maximum `h_Index` where the condition holds is our final h-index.

    - ### Example Walkthrough
        Let's say `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`.

        1. **Sort the Citations**: `[0, 1, 3, 5, 6]`
        2. **Iterate with h_Index**:
            - `h_Index = 0`: `citations[4] = 6`, which is greater than `0`. So, increment `h_Index`.
            - `h_Index = 1`: `citations[3] = 5`, which is greater than `1`. So, increment `h_Index`.
            - `h_Index = 2`: `citations[2] = 3`, which is greater than `2`. So, increment `h_Index`.
            - `h_Index = 3`: `citations[1] = 1`, which is less than `3`. So, we stop here.

        The maximum `h_Index` where the condition holds is `3`, so the h-index for this list is `3`.


    - ### Time Complexity   
        - **Sorting**: Sorting the list takes `O(n log n)`.
        - **Iteration**: Checking the condition in the loop is `O(n)` since we only iterate through the list once.

            Overall, the time complexity is **`O(n log n)`**.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - We only need constant extra space (`O(1)`) if sorting can be done in-place. Otherwise, the space complexity for sorting is `O(n)`.

    - ### Code
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
                    # Initialize h-index counter
                    h_Index = 0
                    
                    # Sort the citations in ascending order
                    citations.sort()

                    # Iterate to find the maximum h-index
                    # h-index is the maximum number where 'h' papers have at least 'h' citations
                    while (h_Index < len(citations) and 
                        citations[len(citations) - 1 - h_Index] > h_Index): 
                        h_Index += 1  # Increment h-index if the condition holds

                    return h_Index  # Return the computed h-index
            ```
        - **C++ Solution**
            ```C++ []
            class Solution {
                public:
                    int hIndex(vector<int> citations) {
                        // Initialize h-index counter
                        int h_Index = 0, n = citations.size();

                        // Sort citations in ascending order
                        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());

                        // Loop to find the maximum h-index
                        // The h-index is the maximum value where h papers have at least h citations
                        for (; h_Index < n && citations[n - 1 - h_Index] > h_Index; ++h_Index);

                        return h_Index;  // Return the computed h-index
                    }
            };
            ```

- ## Approach 2: Counting
    - ### Intuition
        - The h-index is a metric used to measure a researcher's productivity and citation impact. Given a list of citations for each paper, the h-index is defined as the maximum value `h` such that the researcher has published `h` papers, each cited at least `h` times.

    - ### Example of h-Index:
        If a researcher has the following citation counts: `[3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, their h-index is `3` because:
        - There are `3` papers with at least `3` citations each (`[3, 5, 6]`).
        - Increasing `h` to `4` would require `4` papers with at least `4` citations, which is not satisfied.

    - ### Approach
        1. **Count Citations with a Frequency Array**: 
            - First, create an array `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation` of size `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of papers). This array will count the number of papers with each possible citation count.
            - If a paper has more than `n` citations, count it in the last index (`no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[n]`) since citations greater than `n` don't affect the h-index calculation.

        2. **Calculate h-Index**:
            - Start with `h_Index = n`, which is the maximum possible h-index.
            - Sum the number of papers with `h_Index` or more citations.
            - Decrement `h_Index` until the cumulative number of papers with `h_Index` or more citations is at least `h_Index`. This meets the h-index condition.

        3. **Return the Result**:
            - Once we find the highest possible `h_Index` where the condition holds, return it as the h-index.

    - ### Example Walkthrough
        Letâ€™s take the citation list: `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`.

        1. **Initialize Frequency Array**: 
            - Let `n = 5` (number of papers).
            - We initialize an array `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation` with size `6` (indices `0` to `5`), all initialized to `0`.

        2. **Populate Frequency Array**:
            - For each citation count in `citations`, update the array as follows:
                - Citation `3`: Increment `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[3]`.
                - Citation `0`: Increment `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[0]`.
                - Citation `6`: Since `6 > 5`, increment `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[5]`.
                - Citation `1`: Increment `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[1]`.
                - Citation `5`: Increment `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[5]`.
        
            - The final array becomes: `[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]`.

        3. **Calculate h-Index**:
            - Start with `h_Index = 5` and `sum_of_All_Citations = no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[5] = 2`.
            - Since `sum_of_All_Citations (2) < h_Index (5)`, decrement `h_Index` to `4` and add `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation[4]` to `sum_of_All_Citations`.
            - Continue this process until `h_Index = 3`, where `sum_of_All_Citations (3) >= h_Index (3)`.

        The maximum `h_Index` that satisfies the condition is `3`, so the h-index for this list is `3`.


    - ### Time Complexity
        - **Counting Citations**: Populating the frequency array takes `O(n)` time since we iterate over the `citations` list once.
        - **Calculating h-Index**: The loop to calculate the h-index also takes `O(n)` time.

        Overall, the time complexity is **`O(n)`**.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - We use an additional array `no_of_Papers_For_Each_Citation` of size `n + 1`. Thus, the space complexity is **`O(n)`**.

    - ### Code
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
                    # Get the number of papers
                    n = len(citations)

                    # Initialize an array to count the number of papers with each possible citation count
                    # This array will have size n + 1, where index i stores the count of papers with i citations
                    # If a paper has more than n citations, it is counted in the last index (no_of_Papers_For_Citations[n])
                    no_of_Papers_For_Citation = [0] * (n + 1)

                    # Populate the citation counts array
                    for citation in citations:
                        # For citations greater than n, count them at index n
                        no_of_Papers_For_Citation[min(n, citation)] += 1

                    # Start with the highest possible h-index (n) and calculate the sum of papers with that many or more citations
                    h_Index = n
                    sum_of_All_Citations = no_of_Papers_For_Citation[h_Index]

                    # Reduce h_Index while the sum of papers with citations >= h_Index is less than h_Index
                    while h_Index > sum_of_All_Citations:
                        h_Index -= 1
                        sum_of_All_Citations += no_of_Papers_For_Citation[h_Index]

                    # Return the computed h-index
                    return h_Index
